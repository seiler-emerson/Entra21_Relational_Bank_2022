# What is a relational database?

- Relationship databases are a type of database that stores and organizes data points with relationships for quick access.
- With a database of relational representations, data is organized into tables that contain information about each entity and pre-defined categories through rows and columns.
- The data structure makes access efficient and in this way, databases relate more commonly.
- Databases are created for the SQL language, a standardized programming language that is also used for programming, manipulating and restoring data.
- In SQL, there is a built-in language for creating tables called DDL (Data Definition Language) and a language for manipulating data called DML (Data Manipulation Language).
-  What does relational mean? Relational means to indicate or constitute a relationship.
- In the context of databases, the way we define relational applies primarily to the data itself.
- For example, a database that includes a company's customer information might also include data for individuals attached to each account. Related databases focus attention on the relationship between stored data elements.
